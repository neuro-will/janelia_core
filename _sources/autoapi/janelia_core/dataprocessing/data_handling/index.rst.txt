.. py:function:: split_images(image_files: list, base_split_folder: pathlib.Path, split_labels: list, split_inds: list, h5_data_group: str = 'default', sc: pyspark.SparkContext = None)

   Reads in a list of images and splits them, saving new images.

   This function is designed with the idea of splitting multi-color images that have been saved together.
   It will save split data in .h5 files.

   Args:
       image_files: list of image files as pathlib.Path objects

       base_split_folder: the folder to put the split data into.  If this exists, this function will throw an error
       (so users don't accidently overwrite previously split images.)

       split_labels: The labels to associate with each split.

       split_inds: a list.  Each entry contains is itself with start and end indices for a split. A value of -1
       indicates the last entry of a dimension.

       h5_data_group: The name of the h5 datagroup to save the split data in for each split file

       sc: If provided, spark will be used to speed up computation.
