.. py:function:: dict_find(d: dict, vl: object) -> object

   Searches a dictionary's fields, which must be sequences, and returns key to a field containing the value.

   This function assumes each field in the dictionary is a sequence.  It then searches the sequence associated with
   each key.  It returns the first key for which a matching value is found in its sequence.  If the value is not
   found in the sequences for any key, None is returned.

   Args:
       d: The dictionary to search.  Each field must be a sequence.

       vl: The value to search for equality for

   Returns:
       k: The key of the fist field found with a match.  If not match is found, None is returned.
