.. py:function:: plot_segmented_signal(tm_pts: numpy.ndarray, sig: numpy.ndarray, ax: matplotlib.pyplot.Axes = None, delta: float = 0.6, remove_tm_btw_chunks: bool = True, tm_padding: float = 1.0, color: str = 'k', linewidth: float = 1.0) -> matplotlib.pyplot.Axes

   Plots a signal that exists at different chunks in time.

   Each chunk will be plotted as a separate trace, and the user can chose to remove time between chunks.

   Args:
       tm_pts: The array of time points the signal is sampled at

       sig: The array of signal values

       ax: Axes to plot into.  If None, a figure with axes will be crated.

       delta: The threshold to use when determining if two sequential time points belong to the same chunk or not

       remove_tm_btw_chunks: True if time periods between chunks should be removed

       tm_padding: The amount of padding (in units of time) to add between chunks

       color: The color to plot the signal in

       linewidth: The linewidth to plot the signal with

   Returns:
       ax: The axis everything was plotted in
