    """ Performs percentile filtering for a single variable.

    This function uses a moving window to calculate percentiles.  The window is determined by two parameters:
    window_length and filter_start. Window_length is the number of data points in the window.

    The location in the data where filtering is started is determined by filter_start, which gives the
    index of the first value of data that should be in the window.  Negative filter_starts are acceptable
    to indicate a window which begins only partially overlapping the data.

    Finally, write_offset is the offset between the first sample in the window and the sample in the
    output the filtered value should be assigned to.

    Note that windows at the beginning and end of the data may only partially overlap the data.  In these
    cases, only values in the window will be used for calculating percentiles.

    Here are some examples.  To perform standard, acausal filtering with a window of size 101 set:

        window_length = 101

        filter_start = -50

        write_offset = 50

    To perform standard, causal filtering with a window of size 101 set:

        window_length = 101

        filter_start: 0

        write_offset = 100

        window_length: The length of samples in a window

        filter_start: The index into the data for the start of the first window.  Negative values indicate
        the first window only partially overlaps the data.

        value is written to.

        p: The percentile to use in the baseline calculations.

        n_hist_bins: Percentiles are calculated using a histogram binning technique to improve computational
        efficiency.  This is the number of bins to use in the histogram between the min and max value in the data.
